# Feedback Framework

This framework provides guidelines for giving and receiving feedback that promotes growth, improves collaboration, and strengthens relationships.

## The Value of Effective Feedback

Healthy feedback processes:
- Accelerate learning and skill development
- Prevent small issues from becoming major problems
- Build trust and psychological safety
- Improve work quality and outcomes
- Strengthen relationships and team cohesion

## Core Principles for Effective Feedback

### 1. Purpose-Driven

All feedback should serve a clear purpose:
- To improve performance
- To strengthen relationships
- To align expectations
- To acknowledge and reinforce positive behaviors

Feedback without a constructive purpose is criticism, not feedback.

### 2. Timely

Feedback should be given when:
- The situation is still fresh and relevant
- The recipient has adequate time and space to process it
- Emotions are not running too high
- There is opportunity to apply the feedback

### 3. Specific and Behavioral

Effective feedback:
- Focuses on observable behaviors, not personality
- References specific situations and examples
- Clarifies impact and consequences
- Suggests alternative approaches when appropriate

### 4. Balanced

A healthy feedback culture includes:
- Recognition of strengths and achievements
- Constructive guidance on areas for improvement
- Appropriate ratio of positive to constructive feedback (aim for at least 3:1)

### 5. Dialogic

Feedback should be a conversation, not a monologue:
- Invite the recipient's perspective
- Check understanding
- Collaborate on solutions
- Follow up appropriately

## Structured Feedback Frameworks

### The SBI Model: Situation-Behavior-Impact

1. **Situation:** Describe the specific situation
2. **Behavior:** Describe the observable behavior
3. **Impact:** Explain the impact of the behavior

Example:
- "During yesterday's client meeting (situation), when you presented the alternative solution without discussing it with the team first (behavior), it created confusion about our recommendation (impact)."

### The Pendleton Model: Receiver First

1. **Recipient self-assessment:** Ask what went well
2. **Provider reinforcement:** Add what you thought went well
3. **Recipient self-assessment:** Ask what could be improved
4. **Provider suggestions:** Add your thoughts on improvements
5. **Action planning:** Agree on next steps together

### The COIN Model: Context-Observation-Impact-Next

1. **Context:** Establish the situation
2. **Observation:** Describe the specific behavior observed
3. **Impact:** Explain the effect of the behavior
4. **Next:** Suggest what could be done differently next time

## Giving Feedback Effectively

### Preparation

Before giving feedback:
- Clarify your intention and desired outcome
- Consider timing and setting
- Gather specific examples
- Prepare to listen, not just speak
- Check your emotional state

### Delivery

When giving feedback:
- Ask permission if the timing is unexpected
- Use "I" statements to own your perspective
- Be specific and fact-based
- Balance positive recognition with areas for growth
- Focus on future improvement rather than past mistakes
- Invite dialogue and questions

### Language Examples

Strong feedback statements:
- "I noticed that..."
- "When [specific behavior] happened, the impact was..."
- "One thing that worked well was..."
- "Have you considered trying...?"
- "What support would help you to...?"

Statements to avoid:
- "You always..." or "You never..."
- "Why would you...?"
- "That was wrong/bad/terrible..."
- "Everyone thinks that you..."
- "You should just..."

## Receiving Feedback Effectively

### Mindset

When receiving feedback:
- Approach with curiosity rather than defensiveness
- Focus on understanding rather than responding
- See feedback as an opportunity for growth
- Separate the feedback from your self-worth
- Remember that discomfort is part of growth

### Process

Steps for processing feedback:
1. Listen fully without interrupting
2. Ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding
3. Thank the giver for their perspective
4. Take time to reflect before responding if needed
5. Decide what aspects to implement
6. Follow up on your progress

### Questions to Ask

When receiving feedback:
- "Could you give me a specific example to help me understand better?"
- "What would success look like from your perspective?"
- "What's one thing I could focus on changing first?"
- "Would you be open to checking in with me on my progress in a few weeks?"

## Team Feedback Systems

### Regular Feedback Opportunities

Build feedback into team routines:
- Project retrospectives
- Periodic peer reviews
- One-on-one check-ins
- 360-degree feedback processes
- After-action reviews

### Creating Psychological Safety

To foster open feedback:
- Model vulnerability as a leader
- Acknowledge and appreciate all feedback
- Demonstrate changed behavior based on feedback
- Separate feedback from performance evaluation when appropriate
- Celebrate learning and growth, not just success

## Challenging Feedback Situations

### When Emotions Run High

If feedback becomes emotional:
- Take a pause if needed
- Acknowledge feelings without judgment
- Refocus on shared goals
- Consider a mediator if necessary
- Reschedule if productive dialogue isn't possible

### Cross-Cultural Considerations

Be mindful that feedback norms vary across cultures:
- Directness vs. indirectness
- Individual vs. group context
- Power distance expectations
- Face-saving considerations
- Non-verbal communication differences

Adapt your approach based on cultural context while maintaining clarity.

## Feedback as a Growth Tool

Remember that the ultimate purpose of feedback is growth. Effective feedback:
- Is given with care and received with openness
- Focuses on development, not judgment
- Strengthens relationships rather than straining them
- Creates a culture of continuous improvement

By using this framework, teams can establish healthy feedback practices that drive both individual growth and team success.
